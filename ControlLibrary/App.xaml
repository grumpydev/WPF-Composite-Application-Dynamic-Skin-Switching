        This file isn't used by the application, but it "fools" Blend
        into knowing where our styles our.
        
        Blend has the "please locate this style" dialog, which helps, 
        but can be a bit cumbersome if you have a lot of resource dictionaries
        so this trick can be useful.
        
        Have to watch for Blend updating the main App.Xaml, but it has a 
        habit of doing that anyway (and breaking things).
